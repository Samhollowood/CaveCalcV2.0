## **Introduction**
CaveCalcV2.0 is an updated forward modeling tool for simulating speleothem chemistry. It introduces several new features and improvements for more robust and user-friendly modeling. This repository provides the following resources:

- Source code: `/cavecalc/`  
- Example scripts: `/examples/`  
- API model run examples: `/API_models/`  
- Scripts for the Graphical User Interface (GUI): `/scripts/`  

**Key updates include:**
1. The new Carbonate Data Analyzer (CDA) mode.  
2. Speleothem aragonite precipitation.  
3. U/Ca as a proxy.

## **Features**

- **Forward modeling of speleothem chemistry** with updated tools and examples.
- **Easier installation** for Windows and Linux users. 
- **Carbonate Data Analyzer (CDA):** A mode for analysing and matching measured data with model outputs.  
- **Aragonite precipitation modeling** in speleothems.
- **Readable output** now produces a .csv format, with no need to understand processing of pickle files 
- **Flexible plotting capabilities** for visualizing model and CDA outputs.  
- Supports **Python 3.0 and above** (tested with Python 3.10.12).  



## **Installation**

Installing CaveCalcV2.0 requires the use of the terminal (Mac/Linux) or command prompt (Windows). 

The git command (https://git-scm.com/downloads) is recommened for this particular method of installation. Alternatively, users may download the repository as a zip-file, locally.

1. Clone the repository:
```shell
git clone https://github.com/Samhollowood/CaveCalcV2.0.git
```
   
2. Go to directory:
```shell
cd CaveCalcV2.0
```

3. If you would like to install into anaconda (optional):
```shell
conda activate base
```


4. Install the CaveCalcV2.0 package:
```shell
python setup.py install
```

5. Verify installation by running example:
```shell
cd examples/
```
```shell
python example1.py
```

6. Open the GUI by:
```shell
cd ../scripts
```
```shell
python cc_input_gui.py
```



## Usage

CaveCalcV2.0 allows users to run single models, multiple models, or models using the Carbonate Data Analyser (CDA). Detailed instructions are available in **manual.pdf**. Users can run models via:

- The **Graphical User Interface (GUI)**  
- The `run_models.py` script (in `API_models/`)  
- The `run_CDA.py` script (in `API_models/`)
- Creating your own script, using `run_models.py`, `run_CDA.py`, or  `./examples/` as templates 

`run_models.py` uses default model inputs, while `run_CDA.py` has a select number of inputs, over a range, intended to guide the user on the CDA process. Model inputs can be **added, removed, or modified** to suit the users study. A complete list of inputs is available in **manual.pdf**, Table 2.  

Integrated development environments (**Spyder**, **Jupyter Notebook**) are recommended for editing `.py` scripts. More advanced users may want to create their own `.py` scripts, using the `run_models.py`  or `run_CDA.py` as a template. 


### Defining Inputs for the CDA
Before running the CDA mode, specify the following in the **settings dictionary** (`s = {}`) in `API_models/run_CDA.py`:

- **`user_filepath`**: Path to the measured speleothem data file.  
- **`tolerance_X`**: Tolerance values for proxies (e.g., `d13C`, `d18O`, `d44Ca`, `MgCa`, `SrCa`, `BaCa`, `UCa`). Remove unused proxies.  
- **Model Inputs**: Standard CaveCalc model inputs (Owens et al., 2018).  

A template (`Example_input.csv`) is provided for user data. Modify it by adding/removing proxies and data as needed. Alternatively, the inputs for the CDA may be found in the CDA Settings field within the GUI, which allows users to import their measured data and define tolerance intervals.

### Optional: Defining Output Directory
By default, outputs are saved in `./cavecalc_output/`. Alternatively, the user can specify the output directory by defining the `out_dir` key in the settings dictionary (`s = {}`). Users may also simply define an output directory on the GUI. 

### Running models
After setting the model inputs, importing the measured data, and setting the tolerance intervals, to run the CDA mode:
```shell
cd CaveCalcV2.0/API_models/
python run_CDA.py
```
If you do not wish to use the CDA, there is no need to define `user_filepath`. Simply define the model inputs and optionally, `out_dir`, in the settings dictionary and run:

```shell
python run_models.py
```


### When the CDA is functioning correctly:

It will print:

```shell
CDA is initialised
```
It will then create a CDA_Results folder in the output directory, which will store matches in a .csv file.
For the first match with the measured data, it will print:

```shell
CDA was initialised for the first time in the output directory. Created new All_ouputs.csv file.
```


## Output
When running **CaveCalcV2.0**, whether it be with the CDA, or without, three outputs are generated:

1. **`settings.pkl`**  
   A pickle file that stores all the input settings for the model.

2. **`results.pkl`**  
   A pickle file that contains all the model results.

3. A new **`settings_results.csv`**  
   This is a CSV file that consolidates both the input settings and the model outputs in a single, readable format. Users can now easily observe which input settings correspond to what output, and how the ouput evolves from the soil to the speleothem.

There are several output keys, and the definition of each can be found in the manual.pdf, Table 3

If the CDA is initialised, it will create a CDA_Results folder:
```shell
cd /path/to/out_dir/CDA_Results/
```

containing:

1. **`Matches.csv`**  
   A CSV file that stores the inputs and outputs of all matches with the measured data (and the residual)

2. **`All_outputs.csv`**  
   A CSV file that stores all inputs and outputs of the CDA model runs (and the residuals)

3. **`Tolerance.csv`**  
   A CSV file that stores the tolerance intervals used for the measured proxy data in the CDA

4. **`Input_ranges.csv`**  
   A CSV file that stores the range of model inputs used in the CDA model runs


## Plotting
CaveCalcV2.0 comes with built-in functionalities for generating plots, which are available in the `analyse.py` module. Users can initialize this file and generate plots after running models, or even delve into archive models to produce plots. To do this via python scripting, add the following lines to the bottom of the run_CDA.py or run_models.py script:

```python
import cavecalc.analyse as cca

out_dir = 'path/to/output/' #Path to archived output data

e = cca.Evaluate()  # Initializes the Evaluate class
e = load_data(out_dir) #Load data 
e1 = e.filter_by_index(0, n=True) #Filters out first model step

#Example plot of fCa on x-axis. d13C on y-axis (i.e. outputs). Different lines will be coloured depending on the soil_pCO2 (i.e. inputs), and added to the legend
e1.plot_models(x_key='f_ca', y_key='d13C_Calcite', label_with = 'soil_pCO2')
```
This function plots model outputs with an output key on the x-axis and y-axis, with different coloured lines for each input value in label_with. Users can observe all the model output keys in the manual Table 3. Note, that the model key outputs will change slightly whether Calcite or Aragonite is the precipitate_mineralogy.

There is also an option to plot by points:
```python
import cavecalc.analyse as cca

out_dir = 'path/to/output/' #Path to archived output data

e = cca.Evaluate()  # Initializes the Evaluate class
e = load_data(out_dir) #Load data 

#Example plot of fCa on x-axis. d13C on y-axis. Plot is scatter, it is taking the value of f_ca and d13C_Calcite at the equilibrium with cave air value (final index i.e. point_index=-1)
e.plot_points(x_key='f_ca', y_key='d13C_Calcite', point_index=-1, label_with = 'soil_pCO2')
```

By default, after a **CDA** run, three plots are generated automatically. However, these plots can also be generated manually. To do so, users can apply this example to any archived CDA Data:

```python
# Import modules
import cavecalc.analyse as cca

# Initialize the Evaluate class
e = cca.Evaluate()

# Define path to measured data and archived output directory
user_filepath = 'path/to/data.csv' # Path to the measured data used in the CDA run,
out_dir = 'path/to/out_dir/CDA_Results/' # Path to the archived output directory containing CDA_Results,

# Plot CDA_Results
plot = e.plot_CDA(user_filepath, out_dir)
```
